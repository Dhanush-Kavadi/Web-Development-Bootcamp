 <h1>The Best Movies According to Dhanush</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Sanam teri kasam</h3>
 <p>I like the lead character "Inder". The songs are too good</p>
<h3>Sita Raman</h3>
<p>The chemistry between the couple is just amazing. Indeed all songs are good which makes this movie more beautifull</p>
<h3>Shiddat</h3>
<p>The efforts of the lead character to just get his loved women is just amazing.But I think that climax is unfair.Good songs</p>
